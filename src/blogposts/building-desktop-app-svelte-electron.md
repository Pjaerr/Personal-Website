I watched a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBe--JjrEL8) the other day by Felix Riesberg who talked about using JavaScript and Electron to build desktop apps and it inspired me to see how easy using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) would be. Turns out it is super easy, and just works out of the box!

This blogpost will walk you through creating a basic markdown editor for the desktop using Svelte and Electron. We will be able to edit markdown files and see a side-by-side preview as well as **Open Files**, **Create New Files** and **Save Files** using the Electron API.

Let's get started!

## Getting Setup üê£

1. Clone the Svelte template: `npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-markdown-editor`

2. Run `npm install` to install Svelte dependencies.

3. Run `npm install electron marked` which will install Electron and then the marked library which we will use to convert our markdown into HTML.

4. In the root of the project, create a `main.js` file, this will be our Electron entry point.

5. Inside of the `package.json`, change the start script from `"sirv public"` to `"npm run build && electron main.js"` which will build the Svelte app and then tell Electron to run it.

6. Edit the `public/index.html` file so that all paths have a `.` infront of them. EG: `/build/bundle.css` becomes `./build/bundle.css`. Electron won't be able to find these files otherwise.

7. Finally, add the following meta tag to the head of the index.html file: `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" />`. This won't cause us any issues for this small application, but we will get a warning in our console if not. (https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#csp-meta-tag)

## Connecting Svelte with Electron üñáÔ∏è

Now we have the boilerplate setup, let's connect our Svelte app with Electron by returning to the `main.js` file we previously created.

<!-- The Electron [docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app#electron-development-in-a-nutshell) say that _"The main.js should create windows and handle all the system events your application might encounter."_ -->

A basic Electron app consists of an `app` and a `BrowserWindow` so let's import these:

```javascript
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
```

The `app` is what we use to handle the lifecycle of the application and the `BrowserWindow` is the actual window that will render our Svelte app.

Start by creating a new BrowserWindow once the application is ready:

```javascript
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true
    }
  });
});
```

Note we set `nodeIntegration` to true, this allows us to use NodeJS code within our Svelte files which is where the true power lies!

and then, in the same place, tell it to open the index.html file that Svelte outputs when built:

```javascript
mainWindow.loadFile("./public/index.html");
```

Now, if you run `npm start`, a window should open showing the basic Hello World Svelte app.

## Creating a Basic Markdown Editor üìù

Before we implement the ability to open, save and create new files using the Electron API, let's remove the Svelte boilerplate and implement a basic Markdown editor.

In the `src/main.js` file, remove the props argument:

```javascript
const app = new App({
  target: document.body
});
```

Next, create a component called `Editor.svelte`:

```html
<script>
export let markdown = "";
</script>

<style>
    section {
        width: 100%;
        min-height: 95vh;
        border: 0.1rem solid #333;
        flex: 1.5;
    }

    textarea {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        min-height: 95vh;
        resize: none;
        margin: 0;
        border: none;
    }
</style>

<section>
    <!-- svelte-ignore a11y-autofocus -->
    <textarea bind:value={markdown} autofocus/>
</section>
```

This component takes a prop called `markdown` and binds it to a text area so that the markdown variable automatically updates when our text area is updated. We also autofocus the text area and remove the accessiblity warning as our application only has one input and it is the main focus of the application.

and then create a component called `Preview.svelte`:

```html
<script>
    import marked from "marked";
    export let markdown = "";
</script>

<style>
    section {
        width: 100%;
        min-height: 95vh;
        margin-left: 0.5rem;
        padding: 0.2rem;
        flex: 2;
        background-color: #f5f5f5;
    }

    section :global(*) {
        word-break: break-word;
        white-space: pre-wrap;
    }
</style>

<section>
    {@html marked(markdown)}
</section>
```

This component takes some markdown text, and then uses the [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) library to convert it to html. We then directly output this onto the page using the Svelte `{@html}` tag.

There's nothing fancy with any of the styling, you'll note we use `:global(*)` to target everything under our section. This is because we want to target all of the HTML under the section but Svelte thinks that no HTML exists (because it is dynamically generated) so we would get the `css-unused-selector` warning if we just used `*`.

In the `App.svelte` replace everything with:

```javascript
<script>
  import Editor from "./Editor.svelte";
  import Preview from "./Preview.svelte";

  let markdown = "# You can enter markdown here\n\n**This text is bold**\n\n_This text is italic_";

  let activeFilePath;
</script>

<style>
main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.file-path {
    font-weight: bold;
}

.editor-and-preview {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}
</style>

<main>
    <p class="file-path">
        {activeFilePath ? activeFilePath : "Press 'Save' or hit 'CTRL + S' to save"}
    </p>

    <div class="editor-and-preview">
      <Editor bind:markdown />
      <Preview {markdown} />
    </div>
</main>
```

Here we store a `markdown` variable and tell Svelte to bind it to whatever the value of `markdown` is inside of the `Editor` component which we know is bound to the text area input. So whatever we type is stored inside `markdown` which we then pass into the `Preview` component to be rendered as HTML. 

We also store an `activeFilePath` variable, which we will use later on to show which file is open in the editor, for now, whilst no file path exists, just tell the user to save.

Now if you run `npm start` you should have a usable markdown editor with a live updating preview.

## Saving Files with Electron üíæ

Now we can write our markdown, let's give the user the ability to save what they've written.

In the `App.svelte` file, import the [https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/ipc-renderer](ipcRenderer) which will allow us to both listen for messages from Electron as well as send messages to Electron:

```javascript
const { ipcRenderer } = require("electron");
```

Inside the same script tag, let's use the `ipcRenderer` to listen for a "savefile" message (the message name can be anything you want), we will eventually send this message from Electron when the user clicks a menu item or uses CTRL + S.

```javascript
ipcRenderer.on("savefile", () => {

});
```
Inside of this function, we want to first check if there is an activeFilePath and if there is, we want to send a message to Electron telling it to save the current file contents to the activeFilePath and if there isn't, we want to send a message telling Electron to ask the user where the file should be saved.

This looks like the following:

```javascript
ipcRenderer.on("savefile", () => {
    if (activeFilePath) {
      ipcRenderer.send("saveexistingfile", {
        path: activeFilePath,
        content: markdown
      });
    } else {
      ipcRenderer.send("savenewfile", markdown);
    }
  });
```

This won't do anything yet, as we haven't implemented the corresponding message listeners and functionality in our main process. Let's do that next, starting with saving a new file.

In the `main.js` file, import Menu, MenuItem, ipcMain and dialog from electron and fs from the nodejs standard library:

```javascript
const {
  app,
  BrowserWindow,
  Menu,
  MenuItem,
  ipcMain,
  dialog
} = require("electron");

const fs = require("fs");
```

next, create a function called `createNewFile` that takes a string, this function should open a dialog box to ask the user to name a file and select a location to which it should be saved and then save the file at that location, with that name containing the string provided.

Inside of the `app.whenReady().then`:

```javascript
const createNewFile = content => {
    dialog.showSaveDialog({
        title: "Create New File",
        properties: ["showOverwriteConfirmation"],
        filters: [
          {
            name: "Markdown Files",
            extensions: ["md"]
          }
        ]
      })
      .then(({ canceled, filePath }) => {
        if (canceled) return;

        fs.writeFile(filePath, content, err => {
          if (err) return;
        });
      });
  };
```

In the code above, we use `Electron.dialog` to open a save dialog that will only save (and show) markdown files and then, if the user clicked save successfully, we use the `fs` module to write the file to the file path they selected.

Now we have the function, let's setup the code to call it when we receive a "savenewfile" message.

In the same place, write the following code:

```javascript
ipcMain.on("savenewfile", (e, content) => {
    createNewFile(content);
  });
```

There's one last step before we can save a new file, if you remember, the message listener above only triggers when our Svelte app sends a "savenewfile" message, which can only be sent when our Svelte app receives a "savefile" message. So we must send a "savefile" message from Electron when the user selects save from the menu or hits CTRL + S. You do this by creating a new Menu and adding items to it like so:

```javascript
const menu = new Menu();

menu.append(
    new MenuItem({
      label: "Save",
      accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+S",
      click: () => mainWindow.webContents.send("savefile")
    })
  );
```

Here we are saying, when CTRL + S is pressed, or our menu item with the label "Save" is clicked, send a message to the BrowserWindow (our Svelte app) with the name "savefile". 

One last thing, we must set our Menu as the ApplicationMenu like so:

```javascript
Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu);
```

Now if you run `npm start`, type some markdown, and then hit CTRL + S (or the menu item). You should see a save dialog and when you enter a name and click save, your file should now have saved to the directory you chose.

The next part is adding the message listener for when we want to save an existing file. In the same place as the previous one, add the following:

```javascript
ipcMain.on("saveexistingfile", (e, { path, content }) => {
    fs.writeFile(path, content, err => {
      if (err) return;
    });
});
```
This just uses the `fs` module to create a new file at an existing path (which we send to Electron from our Svelte app).

Here's a diagram showing how the data flows between the Renderer (our Svelte App) and the Main process (Electron):

![Diagram showing the flow between renderer and main]()

Next we will add the ability to open/save an existing file, or to create a new one using the menu.

## Opening/Saving Existing Files üìÇ üíæ

This works in much the same way, I would say even easier!

Start by, in the `App.svelte` file, creating a new message listener that listens for a "fileopened" message that contains a file path and the content inside of the file. When we get this message, store the variables:

```javascript
ipcRenderer.on("fileopened", (e, { path, content }) => {
    activeFilePath = path;
    markdown = content;
});
```

and then in the `main.js` file, in the same place as the `createNewFile` function, create a `openFile` function that will present the user with similar dialog but for choosing an existing file:

```javascript
const openFile = () => {
    const file = dialog.showOpenDialogSync(mainWindow, {
      properties: ["openFile"],
      filters: [{ name: "Markdown Files", extensions: ["md"] }]
    });

    if (file) {
      fs.readFile(file[0], "utf8", (err, data) => {
        if (err) return;

        mainWindow.webContents.send("fileopened", {
          path: file[0],
          content: data
        });
      });
    }
};
```

We get the user's selection, read the file and file path and then send a "fileopened" message to our Svelte app. Whilst we're at it, let's also send a "fileopened" message in the `createNewFile` function so that when we save the new file, it updates the activeFilePath:

```javascript
...})
      .then(({ canceled, filePath }) => {
        if (canceled) return;

        fs.writeFile(filePath, content, err => {
          if (err) return;

          mainWindow.webContents.send("fileopened", {
            path: filePath,
            content
          });
        });
      });
```

Next, let's add a menu item and keyboard shortcut for opening files:

```javascript
menu.append(
    new MenuItem({
      label: "Open",
      accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+O",
      click: openFile
    })
);
```

Now if you run `npm start`, you should be able to click the "open" button in the menu or hit CTRL + O and be presented with a file browser dialog. If you select an existing markdown file, it should open in the editor. We're pretty much there!

Finally, add a new menu item that will create a new markdown file with some template content:

```javascript
menu.append(
    new MenuItem({
      label: "Create New File",
      accelerator: "CmdOrCtrl+N",
      click: () =>
        createNewFile(
          "# You can enter markdown here\n\n**This text is bold**\n\n_This text is italic_"
        )
    })
);
```

üéâ You should now have a working markdown editor!

## Conclusion

With very little code we've managed to build a very basic markdown editor using Svelte and Electron.
