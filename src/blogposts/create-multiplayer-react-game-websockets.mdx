title: "Creating a Multiplayer Game in React using WebSockets"
description: "In this tutorial we'll create a multiplayer quiz game in React using WebSockets where each player connects to a game using their phones like games such as Jackbox"

import Video from "../components/mdx/Video/Video";

[Idea
Like Jackbox but the device that is being connected from also has the quiz on it instead of having 1 main screen and then everybody _needs_ to look at that screen but use their phone to play. Sort of dumbed down functionality wise but the same in everyother scenario.]

## Introduction

Why I am writing this tutorial and what the end result looks like:

<Video

  caption="The finished game"
/>

## Project Setup

- Could decide to go with Create-React-App but this could be an opportunity to favour a simpler workflow like being worked at with Snowpack without the need for loads of complex tooling. Would need to make sure this is communicated and what the alternative would be with relevant references.

üê¶ - Experience with Snowpack

(Put link here to pre-made template on github)

1. Setup basic React application (see above)

2. Setup a basic Node backend that serves the React application using Express (simplifes having the websocket server and client on the same host...but could use a seperate host)

3. `npm install` the `ws` module for serverside WebSockets (briefly mention how this saves us time and is similar to if we used a websocket server implementation in other popular languages such as C# and link relevant libraries for constrast)

## Multiplayer Basics with WebSockets

\*Explain how websockets work at a high level and then insert Excalidraw diagram to explain how WebSockets work with regards to client -> server -> all other clients

<ExcalidrawEmbed url="..." />

üê¶ - Websockets diagram and how great excalidraw is

\*Guide to implementing the most dumbed down version of the clientside and serverside communicating with multiple connections. -- This should be something really simple but also not completely boring, could be something that uses components as a preview into how we'll be working with the project in the future. - Potential Idea would be each client is assinged a colour and then can place a `<Rect/>` component onto the page and the other client's will see it.

## something something more realistic - (Think of a better title obviously)

\*Above example automatically connected everybody to the same "server" or what you'd call a lobby/room in multiplayer games. -- This section should implement, stickin with the "game" above, a room system where you choose to host or join a game, and if you choose to host you start a lobby and have a code to give to everyone else who will use the join option and enter your code.

^^ For this intro "game", really try to dumb down everything and don't think about any abstractions, really shouldn't be spending too long on this as it only lays the foundations.

## Turning it into a quiz

### The Questions

![Gif relating to questions](...)

\*first grab a list of questions (link to pre-existing questions on Github) or make your own set of questions in the following format (note that this can be any format you want, as long as the code we are going to write reflects this)

\*But what about the cheaters? -- Don't worry about them for a game played between friends, but beware that users can theoretically go into the dev tools and find the answers.

### Make it a game (better title obviously)

->Basic example of switch of gameplay, guve all players the same question and instead of them being able to put a rectangle onto the screen, let them select an answer from the list. Reveal, once everyone has selected an answer, who got it right!

->Improve on above by, instead of ending when everybody has chosen, show who got it right but then give them points and then after all the questions have been answered, show who has the most points

## Improving User Experience

\*Vague one, but basically give users avatars (maybe animals idk) and all that stuff.
