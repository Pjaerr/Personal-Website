---

If you haven't heard of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), it is a relatively new JavaScript framework that challenges the norm by shifting the bulk of the work from the browser to the compile step.

In doing that, it brings many benefits, most notably, the ability to ship less code to the browser (as you don't need the entire library like with frameworks such as React or Vue). It does a bunch more stuff that I won't be talking about as, in my opinion, the main benefit of Svelte is how easy it is to get started and how nice it is to use from a development perspective.

## What are we going to build?

So now we have gotten the intro out of the way, let's talk about what we're going to build and why.

When learning a new language/framework it is often de-facto to just build a todo app as it covers most bases and lets you see its usage within a sort of real-world application but to me a todo app is really boring, I use one everyday but I don't really want to build one. That's where this idea comes in.

We're going to create a very simple _Data Visualization_ using Svelte. This data visualization will show, on a map of the UK & Ireland, which regions have contributed most to the English Premier League title wins since its creation in 1992. Don't worry if you don't like sports, everything is applicable outside of sports. The main reason I chose this topic is that there is so much data available, but it is also scoped small enough for an article (hopefully ü§û).

You can find a demo of this data visualization at the following link: LINK_HERE

or you can just view the gif below:

GIF_HERE

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

I won't go too deep into setting up Svelte as there are already guides on this, but the steps below should be enough to get started:

1. Run `npx degit sveltejs/template premier-league-data-vis`
2. Run `cd premier-league-data-vis`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Delete the contents of the default `App.svelte` and `main.js` files.
5. Run `npm run dev`

## The Data üìä

For this project we will need the following data:

- Each team that has won the premier league since its creation in 1992.
- For each team that has won, the season they won and the squad that played in the season they won.
- A list of players from the UK and Ireland who had atleast 1 appearance for a winning team and the region they were born in.

To get the football data I will be using the following [website](https://www.worldfootball.net/winner/eng-premier-league/).

I have already gotten the data and made it into something that we can work which you can find in the github repo [here](https://github.com/Pjaerr/Svelte-Data-Vis-Premier-League/src/Data)

The data looks like the following where it is split up by region and that region has an array of players from the region who have won premier league titles, it also has a regions overall appearances (every player's appearances added together). For each player, we just list the seasons they won, who they won it with and how many appearances they had. It looks like the following:

```javascript
{
    name: "Berkshire",
    players: [
      {
        name: "Neil Webb",
        seasons: [
          {
            year: "1992/1993",
            team: "Manchester United",
            appearances: 1
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        name: "Stephen Hughes",
        seasons: [
          {
            year: "1997/1998",
            team: "Arsenal FC",
            appearances: 16
          }
        ]
      },
      ...etc
```

In your project, create a folder in `src` called `Data` and then create the following files:

- `data.js` - This should hold the data for each region found [here](https://github.com/Pjaerr/Svelte-Data-Vis-Premier-League/src/Data/data.js)
- `regionPaths.js` - We'll get to this in the next section, but this will hold each region of our map as an actual SVG path to be drawn to the screen.
- `getRegionData.js` - This will export a function that takes a region's name and will return all the data associated with that region.

If you haven't already, populate the `data.js` file and the `regionPaths.js` file with the data at the following link: [https://github.com/Pjaerr/Svelte-Data-Vis-Premier-League/src/Data](https://github.com/Pjaerr/Svelte-Data-Vis-Premier-League/src/Data).

Next, inside of the `getRegionData.js` file, import the `data.js` file and work out what the highest number of appearances is for any single region as we will need this to determine how much a region has contributed to premier league wins.

```javascript
import data from "./data";

//Obtain the highest number of appearances that any single region has
let highestNumberOfAppearances = 0;

for (const region of data) {
  if (region.overallAppearances > highestNumberOfAppearances) {
    highestNumberOfAppearances = region.overallAppearances;
  }
}
```

The end goal of this data visualization is to have a map of the UK where each region is coloured in based on their contribution to premier league title wins. To do this we must determine each region's contribution and then assign a colour based on that. 

We'll be using the following colour palette where green = higher contribution:

![Colour Palette](/lets-create-data-vis-svelte/colour-palette.png)

In the `getRegionData.js` file underneath the code you've already written, store the colours in an array:

```javascript
const colourPalette = ["#38003c", "#2a404e", "#274c52", "#265053", "#255454", "#245956", "#226659","#1f735d", "#1c8060", "#198c64", "#169968", "#14a66b", "#11b26f", "#0ebf73", "#0bcc76", "#08d97a",
"#06e67e", "#03f281", "#00ff85"];
```

Next, we want to map the overall appearances of a region to a value in the array of colours. We do this using a formula which maps (0 to highestNumberOfAppearances) in the range of (0 to length of colours array) and then just create a colour property on each region with the hex value:

```javascript
//Map the number of appearances (0 to highestNumberOfAppearances) to a HEX value in the array
for (const region of data) {
  const index = Math.round(
    (region.overallAppearances / highestNumberOfAppearances) *
      (colourPalette.length - 1)
  );

  region.colour = colourPalette[index];
}
```

You can read more on the maths behind this [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/377169/calculating-a-value-inside-one-range-to-a-value-of-another-range) if you are interested.

Finally, in the `getRegionData.js` file, create a function that takes a region's name and then returns the actual data for that region. We also want to export this function as the default function so it can be imported and used throughout our application to gain access to the data:

```javascript
//Export a function that takes a region name and will return the region for that name.
const getRegionData = regionName => {
  return data.filter(region => region.name === regionName)[0];
};

export default getRegionData;
```

In the next two sections we will make sure Svelte is working and then create a component that holds all of our SVG paths creating a full SVG map of the UK.

## The Map üó∫Ô∏è

Now we have our data, we need the map. For this project I am using a map of the UK and Ireland that I found [here](https://mapsvg.com/maps/united-kingdom-counties/). We can download this map as an SVG but we won't be directly using it as an SVG. For our purposes we need each `<path>` within the SVG to be seperated out. This is where our `regionPaths.js` file comes in.

Feel free to just copy the contents of the file from [Github](https://github.com/Pjaerr/Svelte-Data-Vis-Premier-League/src/Data/regionPaths.js) to speed things up if you haven't already.


Your `regionPaths.js` file should look something like this:

```javascript
export default [
  {
    svgPath: "M642.97,979.16L643.67,982.94L647.4,986...",
    name: "Bedfordshire"
  },
  {
    svgPath:"M612.68,1061.2L613.28,1059L614.67,1058.64L...",
    name: "Berkshire"
  },
  ...
]
```

## The `<MapContainer>` Component üó∫Ô∏è ‚Üí üì¶

This is our first _component_, but before we begin, let's write the code that will actually hold our application.

Edit the `main.js` file to include the following code:

```javascript
import App from "./App.svelte"

//Here we use intro:true so that transitions run on initial load.
const app = new App({
  target: document.body,
  intro: true,
})

export default app
```

This is our entry file where we create a new instance of our `App.svelte` component and tell it to add itself to the body of the page using `target: document.body`. We then tell it that we want any animations/transitions on this component and its children to happen when we first load the component (By default Svelte only plays animations/transitions when a component is mounted for a second time). We do this by adding the `intro: true` property, this is important as we want to animate the map by drawing it when you first load the page.

Once you have done this, you won't see anything on the page as you need to edit the `App.svelte` file. As a test, let's pull in our Regions and put their names onto the screen using a Svelte `#each` loop.

In the `App.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  import regions from "./Data/regionPaths.js"
</script>

{#each regions as { name }}
<h1>{name}</h1>
{/each}
```

Here we import the array from `regionPaths.js` as you do with normal JavaScript, we then create an `#each` loop and then for each item in the regions array, we put an `<h1>` tag onto the page with the name of the region inside.

Your page should have reloaded and you should now seen the name of each region on the page.

Now we have our basic setup, let's actually create the `<MapContainer>` component. This component will just be an SVG that lets us put any valid SVG code inside of it and it will be used to house the svgPaths of our regions. This way we can seperate our regions (which are just svg paths) from their parent SVG element.

Start by creating a folder called `Components` inside of the `src` folder. Inside of that folder, create a new file called `MapContainer.svelte`

Write the following in the `MapContainer.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  let width = "100%";
  let height = "100%";
</script>

<svg width="{width}" height="{height}"></svg>
```

This is a very simple component that defines a width and height and then creates an SVG element with that width and height. Obviously nothing will display on the page as there is nothing inside of the SVG and we haven't even imported it into our `App.svelte` file.

Let's make it so we can pass in a width and height to our component when we create it. In Svelte you do this by placing `export` in front of variables within the JavaScript. This tells Svelte that we wish to provide values when we create an instance of the component.

We can also simplify the usage of the width and height as attributes because they are named the same by just removing the `width=` part on the svg element.

```html
<script>
  export let width = "100%";
  export let height = "100%";
</script>

<svg {width} {height}></svg>
```

As we have given the variables a default value, they will fallback to `"100%"` if nothing is passed into the component, you can also choose not to provide a default value and in that case it will default to `undefined` when nothing is provided.

Let's replace the example code with our component,

In the `App.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  import MapContainer from "./Components/MapContainer.svelte"
</script>

<MapContainer width="800px" height="600px" />
```

If you inspect the page using dev tools you should be able to see an empty SVG element. This is obviously very exciting but let's turn this into something more useful!

First remove the export from our width and height variables, we will be deciding this based on the elements inside of the SVG later on so we don't need to provide any values.

Next, we are going to create something called a `<slot>` inside of our SVG element. A slot is a feature of Svelte that allows us to decide where elements placed inside of a component when it is created should appear _inside_ the actual component.

In the `MapContainer.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  let width = "100%";
  let height = "100%";
</script>

<svg {width} {height}>
  <g class="regions">
    <slot />
  </g>
</svg>
```

This means that we can do something like the following in the `App.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  import MapContainer from "./Components/MapContainer.svelte"
</script>

<MapContainer>
  <rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:red" />
</MapContainer>
```

Inside of our component, it will turn into:

```html
<svg {width} {height}>
  <g class="regions">
    <rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:red" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

as the contents inside of `<MapContainer> </MapContainer>` are placed inside of the `<slot>`.

You should now see a red rectangle on the screen.

Using what we've written, let's get our map onto the page.

Add the `#each` loop back into the `App.svelte` file, but this time pull through and put the svgPath onto the page and inside of our `MapContainer` component:

```html
<script>
  import regions from "./Data/regionPaths.js"
  import MapContainer from "./Components/MapContainer.svelte"
</script>

<MapContainer>
  {#each regions as { name, svgPath }}
  <path d="{svgPath}" />
  {/each}
</MapContainer>
```

You should now see the full map on the page. What we've just done is essentially re-create the original SVG but as Svelte components.

You may notice that the map is too big, we can do two things to help us with this. In the `MapContainer.svelte` file above the svg element, we can add some CSS to scale the map.

```html
<style>
  .regions {
    transform: scale(0.75);
  }
</style>
```

This will make it so our map fits within the SVG element, but let's say we didn't know that scaling by `0.75` is the right number (cause it might not be if the contents inside of the svg are different) then we need to make sure the width and height of the svg scale to fit the content inside of it.

To do this we can use the `onMount` function in Svelte to run some code when our component is added to the page. This code should get the bounding box of our SVG once it has content inside of it and then update the width and height to fit that bounding box.

In the `MapContainer.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  import { onMount } from "svelte"

  let svg;
  let width = "100%";
  let height = "100%";

  onMount(() => {
    let svgBoundingBox = svg.getBBox()

    width = svgBoundingBox.x + svgBoundingBox.width + svgBoundingBox.x
    height = svgBoundingBox.y + svgBoundingBox.height + svgBoundingBox.y
  })
</script>

<style>
  .regions {
    transform: scale(0.75);
  }
</style>

<svg {width} {height} bind:this="{svg}">
  <g class="regions">
    <slot />
  </g>
</svg>
```

We import `onMount` from Svelte and then we pass it a function to run. This function does what we described above and, when the width and height change, Svelte automatically re-renders our svg element with the updated values.

One extra thing you may have noticed is that we have a new variable called `svg` and `bind:this={svg}` on our svg element. All this does is store a reference to the actual svg element inside of the `svg` variable. In our use case, this is like calling `document.querySelector(svg)` in vanilla javascript. 

And That's it! It might seem like a lot of effort just to get our SVG onto the page when we could have just put it directly onto the page but this allows us to directly manage our regions outside of the SVG, which is important as you'll find out in the next section.

## The Basic `<MapRegion>` Component üó∫Ô∏è ‚Üí üì¶ ‚Üí üìç

Now we have our SVG as a component, I think it only makes sense to make our paths into components.

Create a new component called `MapRegion.svelte` and make it take an svgPath that it will output onto the page.

In the `MapRegion.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  export let svgPath;
</script>

<path d="{svgPath}" />
```

and then in our `App.svelte` file, import the new component and replace the direct path:

```html
<MapContainer>
  {#each regions as { name, svgPath }}
    <MapRegion {svgPath} />
  {/each}
</MapContainer>
```

Let's say we wanted to be able to specify a fill colour for our path, we'd simply export a variable and then use that variable like so:

In the `MapRegion.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  export let svgPath;
  export let fillColour = "#333";
</script>

<path d="{svgPath}" fill="{fillColour}" />
```

In the `App.svelte` file:

```html
<MapContainer>
  {#each regions as { name, svgPath }}
  <MapRegion {svgPath} fillColour="red" />
  {/each}
</MapContainer>
```

We can also do the same thing for stroke colour and stroke width like so:

In our `MapRegion.svelte` file:

```html
<script>
  export let svgPath;
  export let fillColour = "#333";
  export let strokeColour = "#fff";
  export let strokeWidth = "1px";
</script>

<path
  d="{svgPath}"
  fill="{fillColour}"
  stroke="{strokeColour}"
  style="stroke-width: {strokeWidth}"
/>
```

In our `App.svelte` file:

```html
<MapContainer>
  {#each regions as { name, svgPath }}
  <MapRegion
    {svgPath}
    fillColour="red"
    strokeColour="white"
    strokeWidth="1px"
  />
  {/each}
</MapContainer>
```

This is our very basic `<MapRegion>` component. In the next section we'll spice things up a bit by adding a svelte transition to our map regions so they draw themselves.

## Adding Transitions to our `<MapRegion>` Component üìç ‚Üí üí´

One of the coolest parts about Svelte is how easy it makes animation. This is mostly because it treats it as first-class functionality.

We are going to make use of animation by using the Transition directive.

To get up and running, all we need to do is import the _draw_ transition at the top of our file:

`import { draw } from "svelte/transition";`

and then add an attribute to our SVG path that tells it to draw itself:

```html
<path
  transition:draw
  d="{svgPath}"
  class="path"
  fill="{fillColour}"
  stroke="{strokeColour}"
  style="stroke-width: {strokeWidth}"
/>
```

That results in our SVG that draws itself, although it is each path drawing itself individually:

![Basic Draw Transition](/lets-create-data-vis-svelte/basic-draw-transition.gif)

but we can make it better, let's start by specifying the speed at which we want to draw each path, we do this by changing our attribute to be:

`transition:draw={{ duration: 1500 }}`

where `1500` is the time in milliseconds the animation should take.

Now it's kind of hard to see the actual animation because of the conflicting colours. Let's flip the stroke colour and fill colour for the duration of the animation. We first start by defining a new variable in our script tags.

`let transitionEnded = false;`

and then on our path, we can add an event listener that will set our new variable to true once our transition has ended. Svelte handles all of this for us as it knows when our draw transition finishes.

`on:introend={() => (transitionEnded = true)}`

Now let's add a condition to the fill and stroke attributes to flip the colours if transitionEnded is false.

```html
  <path 
  transition:draw={{ duration: 1500 }} on:introend={ () => (transitionEnded = true)}
  d={svgPath}
  class="path"
  fill={transitionEnded ? fillColour : strokeColour}
  stroke={transitionEnded ? strokeColour : fillColour}
  style="stroke-width: {strokeWidth}" />
```

As a final touch, let's add a CSS transition to our fill attribute so that when the fill colour is set, it doesn't just flash onto the screen.

Add the following CSS rule to the `<style>` tags:

```html
<style>
  .path {
    transition: fill 0.5s ease;
  }
</style>
```

If everything has gone smoothly, we should end up with something that looks like the following, excluding the choppy gif of course:

![Final Draw Transition](/lets-create-data-vis-svelte/finished-draw-transition.gif)

## Adding Interactivity üñ±Ô∏è ‚Üí üó∫Ô∏è

Now our map has some animations, let's take it a step further and make it interactive. In this section we will be making each `<MapRegion>` respond to clicks and log its name to the console.

First navigate to the `<MapRegion>` component and add an empty `on:click` event to the svg path.

```html
<path 
on:click
transition:draw={{ duration: 1500 }} on:introend={ () => (transitionEnded = true)}
d={svgPath}
class="path"
fill={transitionEnded ? fillColour : strokeColour}
stroke={transitionEnded ? strokeColour : fillColour}
style="stroke-width: {strokeWidth}" />
```

This says we don't want to handle the `on:click` event in our `<MapRegion>` component, rather we want to bubble it up and instead handle it wherever our `<MapRegion>` component is used.

We can do this easily by adding the same `on:click` event to our `<MapRegion>` component but instead of it being empty we want to print the name of the component to the console.

In the `App.svelte` file:

```html
<MapContainer>
  {#each regions as { name, svgPath }}
  <MapRegion
    on:click={() => { console.log(name + ' clicked!') }}
    {svgPath}
    fillColour="red"
    strokeColour="white"
    strokeWidth="1px"
  />
  {/each}
</MapContainer>
```

If you open the browser and click on the different regions of the map, you should see the name of that region in the console.

Now let's make it a bit more obvious by storing which region was last clicked and showing it on the page inside of a `<h1>`

Start by creating a variable in the `App.svelte` file:

`let activeRegion;`

and then in the `on:click` event handler replace the console.log with:

`activeRegion = name;`

Finally, add a `<h1>` to the page that just contains the active region:

```html
<main class="app">
  <h1>{activeRegion}</h1>
  <div class="map-container">
    <MapContainer>
      {#each Regions as { name, svgPath }}
        <MapRegion
          on:click={() => {
            activeRegion = name;
          }}
          {svgPath}
          fillColour="red"
          strokeColour="white"
          strokeWidth="1px" />
      {/each}
    </MapContainer>
  </div>
</main>
```

If you check the browser, you'll notice that it says `undefined`, this is because we haven't set any text by default, you can just set the default text of `activeRegion` to be something like "No region selected".

Now if you click on any of the regions you'll see that it shows the region we last clicked. Although this seems simple it is a key part of how Svelte works. Svelte treats every top-level variable in your `<script>` tags as that component's state and when that state is updated, it will re-render the HTML with the updated state. This is all done for us automatically but it is important to be aware of!

As a finishing touch before we move onto the next section, let's just add a tiny bit of CSS so that our regions are highlighted when you hover over them and a condition in our `App.svelte` file so that the active region stays highlighted.

Add the following CSS in the `<MapRegion>` component:

```css
.path:hover {
    fill: #333;
  }
```

and then in the `App.svelte` file add the following ternary condition to the `fillColour` property of the `<MapRegion>` component:

```html
{#each Regions as { name, svgPath }}
  <MapRegion
    on:click={() => {
      activeRegion = name;
    }}
    {svgPath}
    fillColour={activeRegion === name ? '#333' : 'red'}
    strokeColour="white"
    strokeWidth="1px" />
{/each}
```

this says that if the active region is equal to the name of the region being rendered, then fill it in with the grey colour, if not, fill it in red as normal.

If you've done everything correctly, you should have something that looks like the following:

![Interactive Map](/lets-create-data-vis-svelte/interactive-map.gif)

In the next section we will be using the function we created at the very beginning to colour in the MapRegion components based on their contribution to the premier league.

## Visualizing the data üî¢
Inside of the `App.svelte` file, import the `getRegionData` function in the `<script>` tags:

```javascript
import getRegionData from "./Data/data.js";
```

and then for the fillColour property of each `<MapRegion>`, instead of passing in 'red', we can instead just call our function and access the .colour property on it like so:

```html
<MapRegion
  on:click={() => {
    activeRegion = name;
  }}
  {svgPath}
  fillColour={activeRegion === name ? '#333' : getRegionData(name).colour}
  strokeColour="white"
  strokeWidth="1px" />
```

If you've done everything correctly, you should end up with a map that looks like this:

![Map With Colour](/lets-create-data-vis-svelte/coloured-map.png)

This section was a brief one as we did all the work at the very beginning; In the remaining sections we will create a Svelte component that shows all of the data about the region you have clicked. We will also do some housekeeping and make sure everything is styled properly and then we are pretty much finished!

## The `<RegionInformation>` Component üñ±Ô∏è ‚Üí üó∫Ô∏è ‚Üí üóÉÔ∏è
In this section we will be creating a new Svelte component that shows us all the data about a region when we click it.

Let's start by making a new component called `RegionInformation.svelte` in the Components folder. As with our other components, let's make it so we need to pass it a variable when we create it. Call this region.

In `RegionInformation.svelte`:

```html
<script>
  export let region;
</script>

<p>This is the information for {region.name}</p>
```

Now inside of `App.svelte`, import the component and put one on the page to test it out:

```html
  <script>
    import RegionInformation from "./Components/RegionInformation.svelte";
  </script>
  <main class="app">
    <h1>{activeRegion}</h1>
    <RegionInformation region={getRegionData('Derbyshire')} />
    ...
```

You should see the following on the page:

![Example of RegionInformation component on the page](/lets-create-data-vis-svelte/info-for-derbyshire.png)

Now let's build out the component using the data we have given it.

```html
```
